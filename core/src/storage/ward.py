"""Persistent WARD state: the trie root, one per hidden wallet.

The root has to outlive a session. A device that forgets it on reboot verifies nothing
until the next write, and "nothing is checked" is the failure direction that matters --
it looks like ordinary operation.

ONE ROOT PER WALLET, not per device. K_path is derived from the passphrase-dependent seed,
so each hidden wallet has its own trie and therefore its own root. A single shared slot
would hand whichever wallet wrote last a root belonging to another, and every proof would
fail -- so slots are keyed by a wallet_id derived from the same seed (see
`apps.ward.keys.derive_wallet_id`), which identifies the wallet without revealing it.

WHEN THE SLOTS RUN OUT the device does NOT evict an existing wallet. Evicting would
silently strip rollback protection from a wallet the user still has, and they would have no
way to notice; refusing instead degrades only the wallet being introduced right now, which
operates session-only and keeps saying so on screen. Fewer wallets protected, none
silently weakened.

FIXME(ward): no counter is stored yet. One is needed the moment the device can ADOPT a
root from outside itself -- attestation or catch-up -- because roots repeat whenever
contents repeat, so an old signature naming today's root would otherwise be replayable
(ward-design.md 2.4, 8.2: bind on the counter, not the root). While the device only ever
derives its own root, the root it remembers is authoritative and a counter would compare
against nothing.
