from trezor.utils import halt

# this module should not be part of the build, its purpose is only to add missed Qstrings
halt("Tried to import excluded module.")

# explanation:
# uPy collects string literals and symbol names from all frozen modules, and converts
# them to qstrings for certain usages. In particular, it appears that qualified names
# of modules in sys.modules must be qstrings. However, the collection process is
# imperfect. If `apps.common.mnemonic` is always imported as `from ..common import mnemonic`,
# the string "apps.common.mnemonic" never appears in source code, is never collected,
# but then is generated and interned at runtime.
# A similar thing happens in reverse: if module `storage.cache` is always imported as
# this name, then "storage.cache" is collected but neither "storage" nor "cache" alone.
# Which is a problem, because "cache" is a symbol that is added to `storage`'s dict.
#
# We need to avoid run-time interning as much as possible, because it creates
# uncollectable garbage in the GC arena.
#
# Below, every module is listed both as import (which collects the qualified name)
# and as a symbol (which collects each individual component).
# In addition, we list the alphabet, because apparently one-character strings are always
# interned, and some operation somewhere (rendering?) is reading strings character by
# character.
