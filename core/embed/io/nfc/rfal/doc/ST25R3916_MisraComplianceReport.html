This section targets to provide an overview of Guidelines Enforcement Plan (GEP).<br>
 <br>
This document will only focus on STMicroelectronics NFC RF Abstraction Layer (RFAL).<br>
 <br>
The project has been designed to comply with the standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999 ([C99]).

This section targets to provide the main configuration options used for MISRA compliance.<br>
 <br>
The project complies to [C99],<br>
the variables length has been consequently set to a dedicated value (cf 'namelength' option in table above).

<b>Nota: Calculation of Compliance Index</b><br>
The Compliance Index is the percentage of groups which have no messages in them.<br>
For each file it is calculated as follows:<br>
<br>
( Ntotal - Nerror  ) / Ntotal  x 100<br>
<br>
Ntotal  is the total number of enforced rules (i.e. the number of rules that have at least one message mapped to it directly).<br>
Nerror  is the number of rules for which messages appear in that file.<br>
The File Compliance Index is the mean of all the individual file compliances.<br>
