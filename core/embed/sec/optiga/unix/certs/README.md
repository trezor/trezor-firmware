# Certificate chains for emulators

The DER files are generated by asking the staging HSM for the given model, to sign
a certificate for a private key `01000000...`.

When you add a new certificate, please add it to the `certs` directory and generate
the header with `gen.py` (using `xxd` to convert bytes into a C array).
