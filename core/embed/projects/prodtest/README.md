# Production Test Firmware
This document outlines the production test firmware (prodtest) and its protocol.

The prodtest serves two primary purposes:

* Testing and initial provisioning of Trezor devices during production.
* Device bring-up and testing during development.

## Command Line Interface

The prodtest includes a simple text-based command-line interface that can be controlled either by automatic test equipment in a production environment or manually via a terminal application.

Pressing the ENTER key twice switches the interface to interactive mode, enabling basic line editing, autocomplete functionality (using the TAB key), and text coloring.

To exit from interactive mode type `.+ENTER`.

### Commands
These commands begin with the command name and may optionally include parameters separated by spaces.
Parameters are marked with angle brackets (`<...>`), square brackets (`[<...>]`) indicate optional parameters.

Command Format:
`command <arg1> <arg2> [<optional_arg3>]...`

Example:
```
haptic-test 500
```

To retrieve a list of all available commands, type `help`.

### Final Responses
The Trezor device responds to all commands with single-line text responses, which start with either `OK` or `ERROR`.

An `OK` response may include additional parameters separated by spaces. The number and type of parameters depend on the specific command.

Example:
```
OK 2.1.7
```

An `ERROR` response includes an error code and an optional error description enclosed in quotation marks.

Example:
```
ERROR invalid-arg "Expecting x-coordinate."
```

#### Predefined Error Codes:

While commands may define custom error codes as needed, the following are predefined:

* `error` - Unspecified error; additional details may be provided in the error description.
* `invalid-cmd` - The command name is invalid.
* `invalid-arg` - Invalid command argument.
* `abort` - Operation aborted by the user (e.g., pressing CTRL+C).
* `timeout` - The command execution timed out.

### Progress response

When a command needs to send structured data that does not fit within `OK` messages, it can use the `PROGRESS` response. A progress response line starts with `PROGRESS`, followed by any number of parameters separated by spaces.

Example:
```
PROGRESS move 107 164 24824185
PROGRESS move 107 170 24824195
PROGRESS move 107 176 24824204
PROGRESS move 107 180 24824213
PROGRESS move 107 184 24824222
```

### Debug Messages

In addition to lines beginning with `OK`, `ERROR`, or `PROGRESS`, the prodtest firmware may issue lines starting with `#`. These lines contain debug or informational traces and should be ignored by automation scripts in a production environment.

Example:
```
rgbled-set 0 255 0
# Setting the RGB LED color to [0, 255, 0]...
OK
```

## List of commands

### help
Displays a list of available commands. The command optionally accepts a prefix to filter and display only commands starting with the specified characters.

Example:
```
help otp
# Available commands (filtered):
#  otp-batch-write - Write the device batch info into OTP memory
#  otp-batch-read - Read the device batch info from OTP memory
#  otp-variant-write - Write the device variant info into OTP memory
#  otp-variant-read - Read the device variant info from OTP memory
OK
```

### ping

```

### touch-test
Tests the functionality of the display's touch screen. It draws a filled rectangle in one of the four display quadrants and waits for user interaction.

`touch-test <quadrant> <timeout>`

* `quadrant` - A value between 0 and 3, determining the quadrant where the rectangle will be drawn.
* `timeout` - The timeout duration in milliseconds.

If the display is not touched within the specified timeout, the command will return a `timeout` error.

The command does not check whether the touch point lies within the quadrant or not. It only returns the x and y coordinate of the touch point.

Example (drawing a rectangle in the top-left quadrant and waiting for 5 seconds for touch input):
```
touch-test 0 5000
# Initializing the touch controller...
# Waiting for a touch for 5000 ms...
OK 68 246
```

### touch-test-custom
Tests the functionality of the display's touch screen by drawing a filled rectangle at custom coordinates and waiting for user interaction.

`touch-test-custom <x> <y> <width> <height> <timeout>`

* `x` - The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle.
* `y` - The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle.
* `width` - The width of the rectangle.
* `height` - The height of the rectangle.
* `timeout` - The timeout duration in milliseconds.

If the display is not touched within the specified timeout, the command returns a `timeout` error.

The device reports touch events, including coordinates and timestamps (in milliseconds). The correctness of the touch point is not validated and is left to the test equipment.

The test ends after the first lift-up event.

Example (drawing a 100x100 rectangle at position (10,10) and waiting for 15 seconds for touch input):
```
touch-test-custom 10 10 100 100 15000
# Initializing the touch controller...
# Drawing a rectangle at [10, 10] with size [100 x 100]...

# Setting the RGB LED color to [255, 0, 0]...
OK
```

### otp-batch-read
Retrieves the batch string from the device's OTP memory. The batch string identifies the model and production batch of the device.

If the OTP memory has not been written yet, it returns error code `no-data`.

Example:
```
otp-batch-read
# Reading device OTP memory...
# Bytes read: <hexadecimal string>
ERROR no-data "OTP block is empty."
```

### otp-batch-write
Writes the batch string to the device's OTP memory. The batch string identifies the model and production batch of the device.

The batch string can be up to 31 characters in length. The standard format is `<internal_model>-<YYMMDD>`, where YYMMDD represents the provisioning date. For Model T, the `internal_model` is `TREZOR2`.

In non-production firmware, you must include `--execute` as the last parameter to write the data to the OTP memory. Conversely, in production firmware, you can use `--dry-run` as the last parameter to simulate the command without actually writing to the OTP memory.

Example:
```
otp-batch-write T2B1-231231 --dry-run
#
# !!! It's a dry run, OTP will be left unchanged.
# !!! Use '--execute' switch to write to OTP memory.
#
# Writing device batch info into OTP memory...
# Bytes written: 543242312D323331323331000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
# Locking OTP block...
```


### otp-device-id-read
Retrieves the device ID string from the device's OTP memory. The device ID string is unique for each device.

If the OTP memory has not been written yet, it returns error code `no-data`.

Example:
```
otp-device-id-read
# Reading device OTP memory...
# Bytes read: <hexadecimal string>
ERROR no-data "OTP block is empty."
```

### otp-device-id-write
Writes the device ID string to the device's OTP memory. The device ID string is unique for each device.

The batch string can be up to 31 characters in length.

In non-production firmware, you must include `--execute` as the last parameter to write the data to the OTP memory. Conversely, in production firmware, you can use `--dry-run` as the last parameter to simulate the command without actually writing to the OTP memory.

Example:
```
otp-device-id-write 123456ABCD --dry-run
#
# !!! It's a dry run, OTP will be left unchanged.
# !!! Use '--execute' switch to write to OTP memory.
#
# Writing device batch info into OTP memory...
# Bytes written: 3132333435364142434400000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
# Locking OTP block...
```

### otp-variant-write
Writes up to 31 decimal values, each representing device variant options, to device's OTP memory. Each value must range from 0 to 255.

This command should be called after the `optiga-lock` command was successfully completed.

Currently, three values are required during production:
`otp-variant-write <unit_color> <unit_btconly> <unit_packaging>`.

In non-production firmware, you must include `--execute` as the last parameter to write the data to the OTP memory. Conversely, in production firmware, you can use `--dry-run` as the last parameter to simulate the command without actually writing to the OTP memory.

Example (to write 3 bytes into OTP memory):
```
otp-variant-write 2 3 5 --dry-run
#
# !!! It's a dry run, OTP will be left unchanged.
# !!! Use '--execute' switch to write to OTP memory.
#
# Writing device batch info into OTP memory...
# Bytes written: 0102030500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
# Locking OTP block...
OK
```

### otp-variant-read
Retrieves 32 bytes stored in the device's OTP memory block, representing device variant options. Each value ranges from 0 to 255. The first byte indicates the format version, followed by the bytes written using the `otp-variant-write command`, and padded with zero bytes.

Example:
```
otp-variant-read
# Reading device OTP memory...
# Bytes read: <hexadecimal string>
OK 1 2 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
