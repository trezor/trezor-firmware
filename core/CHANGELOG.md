## 2.4.2 [16th September 2021]

### Added
- [emulator] Added option to dump detailed Micropython memory layout  [#1557]
- Support for Ethereum EIP1559 transactions  [#1604]
- Re-enabled Firo support  [#1767]

### Changed
- Converted all remaining code to common layouts.  [#1545]

- Refer to `m/48'/...` multisig derivation paths as BIP-48 instead of Purpose48.  [#1744]

### Removed
- Removed support for Lisk  [#1765]
