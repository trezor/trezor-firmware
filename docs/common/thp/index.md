# Trezor–Host Protocol

This section specifies a secure protocol for encrypted and authenticated communication between a host application, such as *Trezor Suite*, and new *Trezor* models (since 2025). This protocol replaces the unencrypted Codec v1 protocol used in earlier Trezor models (see [protocol.md](../../../common/protob/protocol.md)).
