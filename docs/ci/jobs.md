# CI pipeline
(Generated automatically by `tools/generate_ci_docs.py`. Do not edit by hand.)

It consists of multiple stages below, each having one or more jobs
Latest CI pipeline of master branch can be seen at [https://gitlab.com/satoshilabs/trezor/trezor-firmware/-/pipelines/master/latest](https://gitlab.com/satoshilabs/trezor/trezor-firmware/-/pipelines/master/latest)

## ENVIRONMENT stage - [environment.yml](../../ci/environment.yml)
Connected with creating the testing image for CI.

Consists of **3 jobs** below:

### [.environment](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/environment.yml#L7)
Environment job builds the `ci/Dockerfile` and pushes the built docker image
into our GitLab registry. Since modifications of this Dockerfile are very rare
this is a _manual_ job which needs to be triggered on GitLab.
Almost all CI jobs run inside this docker image.

### [environment manual](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/environment.yml#L31)

### [environment scheduled](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/environment.yml#L35)

Consists of **7 jobs** below:

### [style prebuild](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/prebuild.yml#L16)
Check the code for style correctness and perform some static code analysis.
Biggest part is the python one - using `flake8`, `isort`, `black`, `pylint` and `pyright`,
also checking Rust files by `rustfmt` and C files by `clang-format`.
Changelogs formats are checked.

Check validity of coin definitions and protobuf files.

### [gen prebuild](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/prebuild.yml#L32)
Check validity of auto-generated files.

### [editor prebuild](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/prebuild.yml#L39)
Checking format of .editorconfig files.

### [yaml prebuild](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/prebuild.yml#L46)
All .yml/.yaml files are checked for syntax validity and other correctness.

### [release commit messages prebuild](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/prebuild.yml#L53)
Checking the format of release commit messages.

### [changelog prebuild](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/prebuild.yml#L70)
Verifying that all commits changing some functionality have a changelog entry
or contain `[no changelog]` in the commit message.

## TEST-HW stage - [test-hw.yml](../../ci/test-hw.yml)

Consists of **5 jobs** below:

### [hardware core regular device test](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/test-hw.yml#L25)
[Device tests](../docs/tests/device-tests.md) that run against an actual physical Trezor T.
The device needs to have special bootloader, found in `core/embed/bootloader_ci`, that
makes it possible to flash firmware without confirmation on the touchscreen.

All hardware tests are run nightly on the `master` branch, as well as on push to branches
with whitelisted prefix. If you want hardware tests ran on your branch, make sure its
name starts with `hw/`.

Currently it's not possible to run all regular TT tests without getting into
a state where the micropython heap is too fragmented and allocations fail
(often manifesting as a stuck test case). For that reason some tests are
skipped.

### [hardware core btconly device test](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/test-hw.yml#L54)
Also device tests on physical Trezor T but with Bitcoin-only firmware.

### [hardware core monero test](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/blob/master/ci/test-hw.yml#L83)

This works thanks to [tpmb](https://github.com/mmahut/tpmb), which is a small arduino
device capable of pushing an actual buttons on the device.
