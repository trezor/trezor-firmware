# Trezor Core

Trezor Core is the second-gen firmware running on Trezor devices. It currently runs on Trezor T only, but it will probably be used on Trezor One in future as well (see issue [#24](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/issues/24)).

Trezor Core is part of the trezor-firmware monorepo to be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware), in the `core` subdirectory.
