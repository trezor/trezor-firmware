# Testing

We have two types of tests in Core:

1. Unit tests that are specific to Trezor Core.
2. Common tests, which are common to both Trezor Core (Model T) and Legacy (Model one). Device tests belong to this category.

## Core tests

See the `core/tests/` directory.

## Common tests

See the [tests](../../tests/index.md) section.
