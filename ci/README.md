# CI

This directory contains some ancillary files for the CI pipeline:

* Dockerfile for the main CI environment,
* nix-shell configuration for the reproducible Nix environment,
* nix module for our specific version of Pyright,
* scripts to synchronize `trezor-common` repository,
* scripts to generate UI artifacts,
* some more complex checker scripts.
