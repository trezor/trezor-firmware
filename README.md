### CI

The complete test suite is running on our internal GitLab CI. If you are an external contributor, we also have a [Travis instance](https://travis-ci.org/trezor/trezor-firmware) where a small subset of tests is running as well - mostly style and easy fast checks, which are quite common to fail for new contributors.
