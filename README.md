## CI

The complete test suite is running on a public [GitLab CI](https://gitlab.com/satoshilabs/trezor/trezor-firmware). If you are an external contributor, we also have a [Travis instance](https://travis-ci.org/trezor/trezor-firmware) where a small subset of tests is running as well - mostly style and easy fast checks, which are quite common to fail for new contributors.
