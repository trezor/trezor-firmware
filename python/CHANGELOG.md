# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

_At the moment, the project does **not** adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). That is expected to change with version 1.0._

### Incompatible changes

- removed support for Python 3.3 and 3.4

- protobuf classes now use a `get_fields()` method instead of `FIELDS` field [#312]
- all methods on `TrezorClient` class are now in separate modules and take a `TrezorClient` instance as argument [#276]
- mixin classes are also removed, you are not supposed to extend `TrezorClient` anymore
- `TrezorClientDebugLink` was moved to `debuglink` module
- changed signature of `trezorlib.btc.sign_tx`
- `@field` decorator was replaced by an argument to `@expect`

- Zencash support [#287]
- Cardano support [#300]
- Ontology support [#301]
- Tezos support [#302]
- Capricoin support [#325]
- limited Monero support (can only get address/watch key, monerowallet is required for signing)
- support for input flow in tests makes it easier to control complex UI workflows [#314]
- `protobuf.dict_to_proto` can create a protobuf instance from a plain dict
- support for smarter methods in trezord 2.0.25 and up
- support for seedless setup
- trezorctl: firmware handling is greatly improved [#304], [#308]
- trezorctl: Bitcoin-like signing flow is more user-friendly
- `tx_api` now supports Blockbook backend servers

### Changed

- better reporting for debuglink expected messages
- replaced Ed25519 module with a cleaner, optimized version
- further reorganization of transports makes them more robust when dependencies are missing
- codebase now follows [Black](https://github.com/ambv/black) code style
- in Qt modules, Qt5 is imported first [#315]
- `TxApiInsight` is just `TxApi`
- `device.reset` and `device.recover` now have reasonable defaults for all arguments
- protobuf classes are no longer part of the source distribution and must be compiled locally [#284]
- Stellar: addresses are always strings

### Removed

- `set_tx_api` method on `TrezorClient` is replaced by an argument for `sign_tx`
- caching functionality of `TxApi` was moved to a separate test-support class
- Stellar: public key methods removed
- `EncryptMessage` and `DecryptMessage` actions are gone

### Fixed:

- `TrezorClient` can now detect when a HID device is removed and a different one is plugged in on the same path
- trezorctl now works with Click 7.0 and considers "`_`" and "`-`" as same in command names [#314]
- bash completion fixed
- Stellar: several bugs in the XDR parser were fixed

## [0.10.2] - 2018-06-21

[0.10.2]: https://github.com/trezor/python-trezor/compare/v0.10.1...v0.10.2

### Added

- `stellar_get_address` and `_public_key` functions support `show_display` parameter
- trezorctl: `stellar_get_address` and `_public_key` commands for the respective functionality

### Removed

- trezorctl: `list_coins` is removed because we no longer parse the relevant protobuf field
  (and newer Trezor firmwares don't send it) [#277]

### Fixed

- test support module was not included in the release, so code relying on the deprecated `ckd_public` module would fail [#280]

## [0.10.1] - 2018-06-11

[0.10.1]: https://github.com/trezor/python-trezor/compare/v0.10.0...v0.10.1

- support for "auto lock delay" feature
- `TrezorClient` takes an additional argument `state` that allows reusing the previously entered passphrase [#241]
- USB transports mention udev rules in exception messages [#245]
- `log.enable_debug_output` function turns on wire logging, instead of having to use `TrezorClientVerbose`
- BIP32 paths now support `123h` in addition to `123'` to indicate hardening

- `client.format_protobuf` is moved to `protobuf.format_message`
- `tools.Hash` is renamed to `tools.btc_hash`
- `coins` module `coins_txapi` is renamed to `tx_api`.
  `coins_slip44` is renamed to `slip44`.

- `client.PRIME_DERIVATION_FLAG` is removed in favor of `tools.HARDENED_FLAG` and `tools.H_()`
- hard dependency on Ethereum libraries and HIDAPI is changed into extras that need to be
  specified explicitly. Require `trezor[hidapi]` or `trezor[ethereum]` to get them.
