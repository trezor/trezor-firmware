# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

_At the moment, the project does **not** adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). That is expected to change with version 1.0._

## [0.12.0] - 2020-04-01
[0.12.0]: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/compare/python/v0.11.6...python/v0.12.0

### Incompatible changes

- `trezorlib.coins`, `trezorlib.tx_api`, and the file `coins.json`, were removed
- `TrezorClient` argument `ui` is now mandatory. `state` argument was renamed to `session_id`.
- UI callback `get_passphrase()` has a new argument `available_on_device`.
- API for `cosi` module was changed
- other changes may also introduce incompatibilities, please review the full list below

### Added

- support for firmwares 1.9.0 and 2.3.0
- Model T now defaults to entering passphrase on device. New trezorctl option `-P`
  enforces entering passphrase on host.
- support for "passphrase always on device" mode on model T
- new trezorctl command `get-session` and option `-s` allows entering passphrase once
  for multiple subsequent trezorctl operations
- built-in functionality of UdpTransport to wait until an emulator comes up, and the
  related command `trezorctl wait-for-emulator`

- when updating firmware, user is warned that the requested version does not match their device [f#823]
- `trezorctl list` can now show name, model and id of device

### Changed

- `trezorlib.tx_api.json_to_tx` was reduced to only support Bitcoin fields, and moved
  to `trezorlib.btc.from_json`.
- API for `cosi` module was streamlined: `verify_m_of_n` is now `verify`, the old
  `verify` is `verify_combined`
- internals of firmware parsing were reworked to support signing firmware headers
- `get_default_client` respects `TREZOR_PATH` environment variable
- UI callback `get_passphrase` has an additional argument `available_on_device`,
  indicating that the connected Trezor is capable of on-device entry
- `Transport.write` and `read` method signatures changed to accept bytes instead of
  protobuf messages
- trezorctl subcommands have a common `@with_client` decorator that manages exception
  handling and connecting to device

### Fixed

- trezorctl does not print empty line when there is no output
- trezorctl cleanly reports wire exceptions [f#226]

### Removed

- `trezorlib.tx_api` was removed
- `trezorlib.coins` and coin data was removed

- `btc.sign_tx` will not preload transaction data from `prev_txes`, as usage with TxApi
  is being removed
- PIN protection and passphrase protection for `ping()` command was removed
- compatibility no-op code from trezorlib 0.9 was removed from `trezorlib.client`
- `trezorlib.tools.CallException` was dropped, use `trezorlib.exceptions.TrezorFailure` instead


## [0.11.6] - 2019-12-30
[0.11.6]: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/compare/python/v0.11.5...python/v0.11.6

### Added

### Fixed

- fixed "expand words" functionality in `trezorctl device recover` [f#778]

### Removed

- trezorctl no longer interactively signs Bitcoin-like transactions, the only allowed
  input format is JSON. See [`docs/transaction-format.md`](docs/transaction-format.md)
  for details.
- support for "load device by xprv" was removed from firmware and trezorlib


## [0.11.5] - 2019-09-26

[0.11.5]: https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware/compare/python/v0.11.4...python/v0.11.5

### Added

- trezorctl can dump raw protobuf bytes in debug output [f#117]
- trezorctl shows a warning when activating Shamir Backup if the device does not support it [f#445]
- warnings are emitted when encountering unknown value for a protobuf enum [f#363]
- debug messages show enum value names instead of raw numbers
- support for packed repeated encoding in the protobuf decoder
- in `trezorctl firmware-update`, the new `--beta` switch enables downloading beta
  firmwares. By default, only stable firmware is used. [f#411], [f#420]
- in `trezorctl firmware-update`, the new `--bitcoin-only` switch enables downloading
  Bitcoin-only firmware
- support for FIDO2 resident credential management

### Changed

- package directory structure was changed: `src` subdirectory contains sources and
  `tests` subdirectory contains tests, so that cwd is not cluttered
- `trezorctl` script was moved into a module `trezorlib.cli.trezorctl` and is launched
  through the `entry_points` mechanism. This makes it usable on Windows
