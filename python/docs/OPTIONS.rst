Ethereum commands.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

  trezorctl ethereum --help

.. code::

  Usage: trezorctl ethereum [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

    Ethereum commands.

    Most Ethereum commands now require the host to specify definition of a network and possibly an
    ERC-20 token. These definitions can be automatically fetched using the `-a` option.

    You can also specify a custom definition source using the `-d` option. Allowable values are:

    - HTTP or HTTPS URL
    - path to local directory
    - path to local tar archive
    

    For debugging purposes, it is possible to force use a specific network and token definition by
    using the `--network` and `--token` options. These options accept either a path to a file with a
    binary blob, or a hex-encoded string.

  Options:
    -d, --definitions TEXT  Source for Ethereum definition blobs.
    -a, --auto-definitions  Automatically download required definitions from trezor.io
    --network TEXT          Network definition blob.
    --token TEXT            Token definition blob.
    --help                  Show this message and exit.

  Commands:
    get-address           Get Ethereum address in hex encoding.
    get-public-node       Get Ethereum public node of given path.
    sign-message          Sign message with Ethereum address.

    sign-typed-data       Sign typed data (EIP-712) with Ethereum address.
